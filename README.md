## Programming Assingment 1

This program outputs to files rather than the terminal, since the output may not be visible in the in
the terminal past 1000 lines.

*Note: This program will output to two files with the names 'problem1.txt' and 'problem2.txt'. It's 
best to run this in its own directory/folder to prevent overwriting any pre-existing data.*

To compile and run:
```
g++ -o run -std=gnu++11 PA1.cpp
./run
```
Or, with no arguments:
```
g++ -std=gnu++11 PA1.cpp
./a.out
```

See the results by opening problem1.txt and problem2.txt for the outputs (respective to the problem number).
```
vim problem1.txt
vim problem2.txt
```
